Amorganda Sorting System
This is a simple Java-based application that helps sort a list of "things" (both living and non-living) based on various criteria. The program allows the user to input five living things and five non-living things, along with their names. After input, the user can sort the list based on different criteria such as:

Entry Order (Number): Sorts the items by the order in which they were entered.

Alphabetical Order (Name): Sorts the items alphabetically by their name.

Date: Sorts the items by the date of entry.

Category (Living/Non-Living): Sorts the items by their category.

The user is also asked to specify whether they want the sorting in ascending or descending order.

Features:
Data Entry: The program collects input for living and non-living things.

Dynamic Sorting: Allows sorting based on user-selected criteria (number, name, date, or category).

Customizable Order: You can choose between ascending or descending sorting order.

Usage:
Run the program, enter 5 living and 5 non-living things.

Choose your sorting criteria and the order (ascending or descending).

View the sorted list.
